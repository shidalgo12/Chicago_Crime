Research Questions:

How have the amounts of various crimes changed over the past decade?

As of 2019, all observed categories of crime have shown a significant decrease since the beginnning of the decade.  All categories that were observed have shown a minimal decrease of 12% in comparison to 2010.  Drug Abuse and Robberies have decreased significantly by 68% and 44%.  It is necessary to keep track of preventative measures to conclude what has driven the significant decrease througout the past decade as we move into 2019.

How has gun-violence impacted select communities?

We found that Chicago violence is very concentrated with over 25% of violent crimes being reported on the West Side.  3 communities in that area (Austin, Humboldt Park & North Lawndale) are among the top 9 communites accounted for gun violence.  Austin individually holds more than 7% of reported gun crimes between 2010-2019 with all remaining communities landing at 4% or less. 

In relation to violent crimes how successful are Chicago police at making arrests?

Our data shows that less than 30% violent crimes have led to arrests.  This raises concern on how closely the Chicago Police Department is responding to such crimes.  The city needs to concentrate on these numbers to determine why arrests are not being made and how this issue can be addressed.  Increased surveillance in public areas may be a productive starting point.

How have homicide numbers fluctuated over the years?

For the first half of the decade of the 2010s, homicides were relatively stable, between the mid- 400's to low 500's each year. Unfortunately, as part of the national crime wave in 2016, homicide numbers shot up dramtically, to 788. Since then, the numbers have been steadily brought down. Note: if a victim dies from their wounds or medical complications related to those wounds, even in successive years, the crime is retroactively listed as a homicide. In the flurry of news articles written in early 2017 commenting on the previous year's spike in crime, the number of homicides in Chicago is often listed in the 760's. By the time we pulled this data in early 2020, that number is in the 780's.

Using linear regressions what can we predict the number of homicides will be?

We performed two regressions. According to a model that uses data from the entire decade (2010-2019), there will be 641 homicides in 2020. According to a model from 2016 onwards, there will be 405 homicides in 2020.

Is using a full past decade of data the proper reference for our linear regression? 

The models view the data in a vacuum, ignoring external events which shape these trends. A nationwide crime wave in 2016 creates a dramtic spike in the homicide numbers. Advances in police strategy and technology have slowly brought the homicide numbers down (shotspotter, increased emphasis on community relations). From a pure statistics standpoint, the r-squared value (measuring how much of the variance of one variable is explained by the other) indicates the model from 2016 Onwards is much more accurate: -0.99 vs. 0.55.

Do community areas with lower levels of eduction see higher homicides?

There is no conclusive link between this sociological metric and homicide rates. In our selected community areas, we find examples of communities with low rates of adult education having both high and low homicide numbers. Of course, our data only covers 2010, giving us a incomplete picture.
