Research Questions:

How have the amounts of various crimes changed over the past decade?

As of 2019, all observed categories of crime have shown a significant decrease since the beginnning of the decade.  All categories that were observed have shown a minimal decrease of 12% in comparison to 2010.  Drug Abuse and Robberies have decreased significantly by 68% and 44%.  It is necessary to keep track of preventative measures to conclude what has driven the significant decrease througout the past decade as we move into 2019.

How has gun-violence impacted select communities?

We found that Chicago violence is very concentrated with over 25% of violent crimes being reported on the West Side.  3 communities in that area (Austin, Humboldt Park & North Lawndale) are among the top 9 communites accounted for gun violence.  Austin individually holds more than 7% of reported gun crimes between 2010-2019 with all remaining communities landing at 4% or less. 

In relation to violent crimes how successful are Chicago police at making arrests?

Our data shows that less than 30% violent crimes have led to arrests.  This raises concern on how closely the Chicago Police Department is responding to such crimes.  The city needs to concentrate on these numbers to determine why arrests are not being made and how this issue can be addressed.  Increased surveillance in public areas may be a productive starting point.

How has the rate of homicides fluctuated over the years?

Using linear regressions what can we predict the number of homicides will be?

Is using a full past decade of data the proper reference for our linear regression? Given the national crie wave in 2016, should we only use data since then for a more accurate analysis?

Do community areas with lower levels of eduction see higher homicides?
