Chicago Crime and Community Education over the Past Decade
Team Members: Cindy Wagner, Stephanie Hidalgo, Nathaniel Al-Najjar

Urban crime has been at the forefront of the national conversation in recent years. We are interested in looking at some specific questions underneath this broad topic in Chicago over the last 10 years. We expect to find a correlation between Chicago crime and the level of education  that will give us a perspective on shifting property values, and have found the City of Chicago’s crime database. 

Research Questions:

How have the amounts of various crimes changed over the past decade?

How has gun-violence impacted select communities?

In relation to violent crimes how successful are Chicago police at making arrests?

How has the rate of homicides fluctuated over the years?

Using linear regressions what can we predict the number of homicides will be?

Is using a full past decade of data the proper reference for our linear regression? Given the national crie wave in 2016, should we only use data since then for a more accurate analysis?

Do community areas with lower levels of eduction see higher homicides?
