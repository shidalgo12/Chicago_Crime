Chicago Crime & Property Values
Team Members: Cindy Wagner, Stephanie Hidalgo, Nathaniel Al-Najjar

The issues of gentrification and urban crime have been at the forefront of the national conversation in recent years. We are interested in looking at some specific questions underneath this broad topic in Chicago over the last five years. We have found property data that will give us a perspective on shifting property values, and have found the City of Chicago’s crime database. 

Research Questions:
Is there a correlation between property values and crime rate?

Does this correlation remain steady comparing residential vs. commercial properties?

Does this correlation remain steady for violent vs. non-violent crime?

How has this correlation changed over the last five years?

Assuming there is, which neighborhoods buck this trend? (i.e. high crime and property rates?)

Datasets to Be Used:
Chicago Property values 2014 – Present

Breakdown of Tasks:
Clean the data and filter for only those years we are interested in

Demonstrate that there is an inverse relationship between crime & property values (make sure we are right)

Sort data to answer the discrete questions above

Use linear regressions, standard deviations, line graphs, and google maps to chart data-Select specific neighborhoods to highlight
